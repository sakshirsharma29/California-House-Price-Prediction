# California-House-Price-Prediction
This project implements a machine learning model to predict house prices in California based on various features such as location, population, and income. It includes steps like data preprocessing, exploratory data analysis (EDA), and model implementation. The aim is to provide insights into real estate trends and build a robust price prediction model.

# Features
- Dataset: California housing dataset from a publicly available source.
- Data Preprocessing: Cleaned missing values, normalized numerical features, and encoded categorical variables.
- EDA: Conducted exploratory data analysis to uncover relationships and trends in the dataset.
- Machine Learning Models:
Built and trained regression models, including Linear Regression and Polynomial Regression.
Evaluated model performance using metrics such as Mean Squared Error (MSE).


# Results
The current model provides reasonable predictions but still requires further refinement to improve accuracy and reliability.

# Areas for Improvement
- Experiment with advanced models like Random Forest, Gradient Boosting, or XGBoost to improve performance.
- Perform hyperparameter tuning for better results.
- Use cross-validation techniques to ensure robust evaluation.
- Deploy the model as a web or desktop application for practical usability.
- Add detailed visualizations to enhance the interpretability of predictions.

# Future Plans
- Implement additional regression models and compare their performance.
- Add documentation and comments for better understanding.
- Explore deployment options using Flask, FastAPI, or Streamlit.
